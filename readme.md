HOW TO BUILD
============

Only Linux build script.

1. Download third party libraries, and build these as static libraries.
```
cd 3rd
./download_3rd_lib.sh
./build_prebuilt_lib.sh
```

or download the file from [release](https://github.com/ningshanwutuobang/Kirikiroid2/releases/)

2. Open prej.android in android studio.


There are some steps left for a runnable apk file.
- Using cocos studio compile ui/layout file *.csd. ( It can be downloaded from [release](https://github.com/ningshanwutuobang/Kirikiroid2/releases/))
- Some files from a real apk (unzip). [Kirikiroid2](https://github.com/zeas2/Kirikiroid2/releases/download/1.3.9/Kirikiroid2_1.3.9.apk )
- Fix some bugs because of incompatible version. (need to fix some bugs)

Now it is runnable, but still some bugs left.

Known issues

- `std::bad_alloc`, a restart may solve it.
